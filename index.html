		<h1>HTTP Requests</h1>
		<p>
			HTTP reqeuets allows us to communictae with a backend/server typically
			through an api to get/send/replace/update/delete data. HTTP requests work
			by sending that request to a particualr url. Each HTTP request has a
			particualt HTTP method which dictates what is done with the data, the most
			common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE. The other parts
			that make up a HTTP request are HTTP Headers and HTTP Body. HTTP Headers
			allow for metadata to be added to the request wth some specific predefined
			metadata the backend/server will understand. The HTTP Body allows us to
			attahc some extra data to the request, typically used when creating (POST)
			data as we add that extra data to be created in the HTTP Body. The HTTP
			request then gives us a response hence seeeing two phases of requests in
			netowkr tab the request phase and then the response. This response comes
			back in a format defined by the backend/server and is typically JSON
			format. Finally when a HTTP request is complete and you get the repsonse
			you will also get the response status code which lets you know details fo
			the response such as if it was successful or not. Status codes in the 200s
			are successful response, codes in the 400s mean there was a client error
			and codes in the 500s means there was a server error.
		</p>
		<h2>XMLHttpRequest Object</h2>
		<p>
			The XMLHttpRequest object is the oldest and most widely supported method
			by browsers for making HTTP requests. You create a XMLHttp request object
			using the 'new' keyword to make an instance of the XMLHttpReqeust object
			constructor function. Then to send a request using this object we need to
			congifure the request, the first step is to call the open method. The open
			method called alone willl not do anything and is instead used as the first
			part of the configuration process, we pass into the open method the HTTP
			method we want to use and then the second arugment is the url where we
			want to send that request. Once the configuration has been set up using
			the open method we then need to send the reqeust which we do by using the
			XMLHttpReqeust objects send method.
		</p>
		<h3>GET</h3>
		<p>
			GET requests allow us to retrieve data from the backend/server. We can
			make GET requests in XMLHttpReqeust object by passing 'GET' as the first
			arguent followed by the url of the request as the second argument in the
			open mehtod. We then need to handle the data in the onload property and we
			do that by assigning it a fucntion in which we JSON.parse the response
			property in cases where our response data is JSON format.
		</p>
		<h3>POST</h3>
		<p>
			POST requests allow us to send data to the backend/server. We can make
			POST requests in XMLHttpReqeust object by passing 'POST' as the first
			argument followed by the url for the request as the second argument to the
			open method. We can handle the response in the onload property however
			this is typically less useful in POST reqeuests as we are sending data not
			receiving. Finally we need to be able to give the data to be sent to the
			backend/server and we do this with the send method where we passs in as an
			argument the data we want to send. We typically transform this data into
			JSON by using JSON.stringify to pass in JSON data to send to the
			backend/server.
		</p>
		<h3>DELETE</h3>
		<h3>Error Handling</h3>
		<p>
			There are 2 main things to use and consider when error handling HTTP
			requests using the XMLHttpReqeust object. Firstly we have the onerror
			property which we can assign a function to deal with error handling.
			However this property is only triggered when we get network errors i.e.
			errors that lead to the request not being sent, any other issues with the
			response etc. will not trigger this onerror. So to deal with other error
			cases relating to after a requests being sent such as errors on client or
			server side or incorrect responses, we have to handle these in onload. We
			typically handle these in onload by checking for success cases first
			before parsing and using the response data. This is done by checking if
			that status code is within the 200s range which indicates a successful
			request.
		</p>
		<p>
			DELETE requests allow us to delete data from the backend/server. We can
			make a DELETE request in XMLHttpReqeust by passing 'DELETE' as the first
			argument and the url for the request as the second argument to the open
			method. DELETE request urls typically are more speicific than other
			requests pointing to a specific piece of data via an id for example
			posts/user/:id. Again we can handle responses if need be with the onload
			property. Finally we use the send method to complete the request.
		</p>
		<h3>Promisifying XMLHttpReqeust</h3>
		<p>
			While XMLHttpReqeust is the most widely supproted method of making HTTP
			requests it is also out of date syntactically and can feel cumbersome to
			work with. We can improve upon the use of XMLHttpRequest by promisifiying
			it thus making it easier to work with the asynchronous code it gives us
			and step through the response data with each '.then' chain. We can
			promisify XMLHttpReqeust by creating a fucntino that takes a HTTP method
			and url as arguments and then crreating a promise inside, executing the
			XMLHttpReqeust inside the promise and then resolving the response data
			inside the onload. By doing this we can make a request passing the same
			arguments we did before for XMLHttpReqeust but now have the added benefit
			of '.then' chaining to work with the response data.
		</p>
		<h2>JSON Data</h2>
		<p>
			JSON Data is typically what we work with when getting api response data
			from our HTTP requests. This data looks simialr to JavaScript but has some
			key differences. Firstly it can only be used to store data in an
			array/object like manner and cannot hold functions/methods. Secondly each
			key of the data is wrapped in double quotes and must always be wrapped in
			double quotes. To work with this data is JavaScript we need to convert it
			to actual JavaScript data and we do that using the JSON object and its
			static helper methods. The JSON object comes with two static helper
			methods 'stringify' and 'parse'. Stringify allows us to convert JavaScript
			data into JSON format whereas parse allows us to convert JSON data into
			JavaScript. Also when using the XMLHttpReqeust object we can set the
			responseType property to 'json' which will then automatically handle the
			parsing for us.
		</p>
		<h2>Fetch API</h2>
		<p>
			The fetch API is a new method for making HTTP requests in a more modern
			syntatcial format that is supported by modern browsers. The fetch method
			is promisified by default meaning that it returns a promise. Specifically
			it returns the requests response object in a promise with particular
			methods we can use to work with the data. The response object promise we
			get returned from fetch still needs to be parsed and we do that with the
			.json method. Fetch gives us this json method on our response object to
			parse the response body into JavaScript. The response object we get back
			in the promise is a streamed response meaning when we call json, text,
			blob or any other of the built in helper parsing methods we are creating a
			snapshot of that streamed response body.
		</p>
		<h3>Fetch API Configuration</h3>
		<p>
			By default just passing a url to the fetch API will make it run a GET
			request however we can configure the fetch API to run any HTTP method we
			want and also give it data to send and many other built in things a HTTP
			request configuration may need. We configure the fetch API by passing a
			second argument to it after the url which is an object that acts as a
			configuration object for the request. In this object we can set the
			method, body and many other predefined properties a HTTP request
			configuration may need. So for a POST request for example we would set the
			method property to POST and the body property to the JSON data we want to
			send. Key note here when we add data to send in the body it has to be in
			JSON format so always JSON stringify first.
		</p>
		<h2>Request Headers</h2>
		<p>
			Request headers are extra pieces of meta data we can add to a request,
			bare in mind adding request headers are only useful if the backend/server
			is expecting them and knows what to do with them. The fetch API makes
			adding request headers easy as we just need to add an object to the
			configuration objects headers property, then each key value pair is a
			piece of meta data to add to the request header. We can also add request
			header data in XMLHttpReqeust using the setRequestHeader method which
			takes in key values pair as arguments.
		</p>
		<h3>Fetch API Error Handling</h3>
		<p>
			Error handling with the fetch API presents the same challenges that
			XMLHttpReqeust does in that a standard error is only thrown with technical
			errors such as connection issues and a request not actually being sent
			rather than getting an error or bad status code after the request. To deal
			with this we have to approach it the same we do for XMLHttpReqeust and
			check for status codes before using the response data. However the issue
			here is unlike XMLHttpReqeust we are in a promise chain and can only go
			into that promise chain further and catch errors by returning another
			promise with the .json method. So although error handling in fetch is
			possible it is rather cumbersome.
