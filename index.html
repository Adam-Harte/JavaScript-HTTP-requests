		<h1>HTTP Requests</h1>
		<p>
			HTTP reqeuets allows us to communictae with a backend/server typically
			through an api to get/send/replace/update/delete data. HTTP requests work
			by sending that request to a particualr url. Each HTTP request has a
			particualt HTTP method which dictates what is done with the data, the most
			common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE. The other parts
			that make up a HTTP request are HTTP Headers and HTTP Body. HTTP Headers
			allow for metadata to be added to the request wth some specific predefined
			metadata the backend/server will understand. The HTTP Body allows us to
			attahc some extra data to the request, typically used when creating (POST)
			data as we add that extra data to be created in the HTTP Body. The HTTP
			request then gives us a response hence seeeing two phases of requests in
			netowkr tab the request phase and then the response. This response comes
			back in a format defined by the backend/server and is typically JSON
			format. Finally when a HTTP request is complete and you get the repsonse
			you will also get the response status code which lets you know details fo
			the response such as if it was successful or not. Status codes in the 200s
			are successful response, codes in the 400s mean there was a client error
			and codes in the 500s means there was a server error.

		<h2>XMLHttpRequest Object</h2>
		<p>
			The XMLHttpRequest object is the oldest and most widely supported method
			by browsers for making HTTP requests. You create a XMLHttp request object
			using the 'new' keyword to make an instance of the XMLHttpReqeust object
			constructor function. Then to send a request using this object we need to
			congifure the request, the first step is to call the open method. The open
			method called alone willl not do anything and is instead used as the first
			part of the configuration process, we pass into the open method the HTTP
			method we want to use and then the second arugment is the url where we
			want to send that request. Once the configuration has been set up using
			the open method we then need to send the reqeust which we do by using the
			XMLHttpReqeust objects send method.
