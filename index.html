		<h1>HTTP Requests</h1>
		<p>
			HTTP reqeuets allows us to communictae with a backend/server typically
			through an api to get/send/replace/update/delete data. HTTP requests work
			by sending that request to a particualr url. Each HTTP request has a
			particualt HTTP method which dictates what is done with the data, the most
			common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE. The other parts
			that make up a HTTP request are HTTP Headers and HTTP Body. HTTP Headers
			allow for metadata to be added to the request wth some specific predefined
			metadata the backend/server will understand. The HTTP Body allows us to
			attahc some extra data to the request, typically used when creating (POST)
			data as we add that extra data to be created in the HTTP Body. The HTTP
			request then gives us a response hence seeeing two phases of requests in
			netowkr tab the request phase and then the response. This response comes
			back in a format defined by the backend/server and is typically JSON
			format. Finally when a HTTP request is complete and you get the repsonse
			you will also get the response status code which lets you know details fo
			the response such as if it was successful or not. Status codes in the 200s
			are successful response, codes in the 400s mean there was a client error
			and codes in the 500s means there was a server error.
		</p>
		<h2>XMLHttpRequest Object</h2>
		<p>
			The XMLHttpRequest object is the oldest and most widely supported method
			by browsers for making HTTP requests. You create a XMLHttp request object
			using the 'new' keyword to make an instance of the XMLHttpReqeust object
			constructor function. Then to send a request using this object we need to
			congifure the request, the first step is to call the open method. The open
			method called alone willl not do anything and is instead used as the first
			part of the configuration process, we pass into the open method the HTTP
			method we want to use and then the second arugment is the url where we
			want to send that request. Once the configuration has been set up using
			the open method we then need to send the reqeust which we do by using the
			XMLHttpReqeust objects send method.
		</p>
		<h3>GET</h3>
		<p>
			GET requests allow us to retrieve data from the backend/server. We can
			make GET requests in XMLHttpReqeust object by passing 'GET' as the first
			arguent followed by the url of the request as the second argument in the
			open mehtod. We then need to handle the data in the onload property and we
			do that by assigning it a fucntion in which we JSON.parse the response
			property in cases where our response data is JSON format.
		</p>
		<h3>POST</h3>
		<p>
			POST requests allow us to send data to the backend/server. We can make
			POST requests in XMLHttpReqeust object by passing 'POST' as the first
			argument followed by the url for the request as the second argument to the
			open method. We can handle the response in the onload property however
			this is typically less useful in POST reqeuests as we are sending data not
			receiving. Finally we need to be able to give the data to be sent to the
			backend/server and we do this with the send method where we passs in as an
			argument the data we want to send. We typically transform this data into
			JSON by using JSON.stringify to pass in JSON data to send to the
			backend/server.
		</p>
		<h3>DELETE</h3>
		<p>
			DELETE requests allow us to delete data from the backend/server. We can
			make a DELETE request in XMLHttpReqeust by passing 'DELETE' as the first
			argument and the url for the request as the second argument to the open
			method. DELETE request urls typically are more speicific than other
			requests pointing to a specific piece of data via an id for example
			posts/user/:id. Again we can handle responses if need be with the onload
			property. Finally we use the send method to complete the request.
		</p>
		<h3>Promisifying XMLHttpReqeust</h3>
		<p>
			While XMLHttpReqeust is the most widely supproted method of making HTTP
			requests it is also out of date syntactically and can feel cumbersome to
			work with. We can improve upon the use of XMLHttpRequest by promisifiying
			it thus making it easier to work with the asynchronous code it gives us
			and step through the response data with each '.then' chain. We can
			promisify XMLHttpReqeust by creating a fucntino that takes a HTTP method
			and url as arguments and then crreating a promise inside, executing the
			XMLHttpReqeust inside the promise and then resolving the response data
			inside the onload. By doing this we can make a request passing the same
			arguments we did before for XMLHttpReqeust but now have the added benefit
			of '.then' chaining to work with the response data.
		</p>
		<h2>JSON Data</h2>
		<p>
			JSON Data is typically what we work with when getting api response data
			from our HTTP requests. This data looks simialr to JavaScript but has some
			key differences. Firstly it can only be used to store data in an
			array/object like manner and cannot hold functions/methods. Secondly each
			key of the data is wrapped in double quotes and must always be wrapped in
			double quotes. To work with this data is JavaScript we need to convert it
			to actual JavaScript data and we do that using the JSON object and its
			static helper methods. The JSON object comes with two static helper
			methods 'stringify' and 'parse'. Stringify allows us to convert JavaScript
			data into JSON format whereas parse allows us to convert JSON data into
			JavaScript. Also when using the XMLHttpReqeust object we can set the
			responseType property to 'json' which will then automatically handle the
			parsing for us.
